The goal of this project is to build a hotel booking chatbot using Amazon Lex, which guides users through the booking process with an interactive and intelligent dialogue. The chatbot is designed to help users book hotel rooms by providing information and performing necessary validations for each user input, such as city, check-in/check-out dates, room type, and number of guests. The system ensures that all inputs are correct before proceeding to calculate the fare and confirm the booking.
The system is backed by an AWS Lambda function that performs the logic for validating user inputs, calculating the total fare based on room type and stay duration, and confirming the reservation. The bot aims to automate the hotel booking process, ensuring a seamless user experience.
